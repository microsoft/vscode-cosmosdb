# Webview e2e tests (Playwright + real VS Code)

End-to-end tests that drive the React webviews under `src/webviews/` **inside
a real, downloaded VS Code instance**. We do _not_ assert against the VS Code
shell (tree view, status bar, settings UI) — that's the job of the
Extension-Host integration tests next door under
[`test/`](../) (run via `npm run test`).

The scaffold borrows heavily from the sibling `vs-code-postgresql` project's
`test/e2e/` setup. We kept the patterns that pay off immediately and skipped
the ones we don't yet need (multi-editor adapter, reusable auth profile,
@tag-based grep filtering, JUnit reporter).

## How it works

```
Playwright
    │  _electron.launch({ executablePath: <downloaded VS Code> })
    ▼
VS Code (real Electron app)
    │  --extensionDevelopmentPath=dist/  → our extension loads
    │  --extensions-dir=.vscode-test/e2e-extensions  → dependent extensions
    │  --user-data-dir=<worker-scoped temp dir, pre-seeded settings>
    │  <worker-scoped workspace dir>
    ▼
Test opens the command palette, runs a Cosmos DB command, finds the
webview iframe by predicate (NOT by aria-label — outer iframe has none),
asserts the React tree mounted, then closes all tabs in afterEach.
```

### Why real VS Code instead of Chromium

The webview runtime VS Code provides is **not just a browser** — it includes
the `acquireVsCodeApi()` global, a custom CSP, `--vscode-*` CSS variables, the
`l10n_bundle` injection, the postMessage transport, and the Electron version
that ships with the editor. Faking all of that in plain Chromium is brittle
and never quite right; launching the real thing avoids the entire class of
"works in tests, breaks in VS Code" bugs.

### Performance: worker-scoped fixtures

`vscodeApp` and `vscodeWindow` are **worker-scoped** (`{ scope: 'worker' }`),
so VS Code is launched **once per worker** and reused across every test in
that worker. With per-test launch (the naive approach), a 10-test file would
pay ~50 s of startup overhead; with worker scope it's ~5 s total.

The consequence: tests **must reset editor state in their own `afterEach`**.
Use `closeAllEditorTabs(vscodeWindow)` from `fixtures/webviewHelpers.ts`.

## Running

```bash
# Run all e2e specs (auto-builds dist/ if stale, starts the emulator,
# seeds the test DB, runs Playwright, then tears the emulator down)
npm run e2e

# Coverage-enabled runs (collect Playwright JS coverage from the VS Code webview)
npm run e2e:coverage
npm run e2e:coverage:query-editor

# Author / debug
npm run e2e:ui         # Playwright's UI mode — step through tests, time-travel
npm run e2e:debug      # Playwright Inspector — pause + step + REPL at each action
```

> **Auto-build:** `globalSetup` compares mtimes of `package.json` + `src/`
> against `dist/main.mjs` and `dist/package.json` and runs `npm run vite-prod`
> automatically when they're out of sync. Set `COSMOSDB_E2E_SKIP_BUILD=1` to
> bypass the check (useful when iterating on test code only).

> **Heads-up on Electron + "headless":** Electron does NOT support a headless
> mode the way Chromium does — every `_electron.launch()` opens a real OS
> window. There is no `e2e:headed` script because there is no headless mode
> to opt out of. On a developer machine you'll see VS Code briefly appear
> on screen while tests run; that's expected. On Linux CI without a display
> server, prefix the invocation with `xvfb-run` (e.g.
> `xvfb-run --auto-servernum npm run e2e`). Windows/macOS CI runners ship
> with a display, so no wrapper is needed there.

The first run also downloads the `stable` VS Code build into `.vscode-test/`
(via [`@vscode/test-electron`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-test)) and
installs `ms-azuretools.vscode-azureresourcegroups` into a dedicated
extensions directory at `.vscode-test/e2e-extensions/`. Both are cached.

## Query Editor coverage (`@queryEditor`)

The bulk of the suite drives the Query Editor webview. Every Query Editor spec
shares two fixtures, and coverage is now enabled automatically for runs started
with `npm run e2e:coverage`:

- **`fixtures/queryEditor.ts`** — the `QueryEditorPage` page-object. It wraps the
  webview `Frame` with intention-revealing actions (`run`, `setViewMode`,
  `setPageSize`, `goToNextPage`, `selectRow`, `openRunHistoryMenu`, …) so specs
  read as user stories. `QueryEditorPage.open(window)` mounts the editor via the
  `cosmosDB.e2e.openQueryEditor` test command; `QueryEditorPage.fromOpenTab(window)`
  attaches to an editor opened by some other affordance (used by the tree-open
  spec).
- **`fixtures/consoleHealth.ts`** — attaches a console listener to the webview
  frame at mount. Every spec ends with `qe.consoleHealth.assertNoConsoleErrors()`,
  failing on any non-allowlisted `console.error` from the panel.
  `CONSOLE_ERROR_ALLOWLIST` is intentionally **empty** — add an entry only for a
  real, unavoidable error and document why inline.
- **`fixtures/coverage.ts`** — auto fixture for coverage-enabled runs
  (`COSMOSDB_E2E_COVERAGE=1`). It collects Playwright's built-in **V8** coverage
  for the VS Code window (no `nyc`/`istanbul`/`c8` dependency), then projects the
  executed byte ranges back onto component **source lines** through the webview
  bundle's source maps. Per test it writes
  `test/e2e/.results/<run-id>/<test-name>/coverage.json` (per-component
  `mapped`/`covered` line numbers); `globalTeardown` aggregates every artifact
  into `test/e2e/.reports/<run-id>/coverage-summary.{json,md}` — a per-component
  covered/uncovered-line report. Two things make this work and are wired up
  automatically for coverage runs: `globalSetup` rebuilds `dist/` **unminified +
  with source maps** (`vite.config.views.mjs` keys off the same env var), and the
  VS Code window is launched with site isolation disabled so the webview iframe
  runs in the page renderer where `page.coverage` can see it.

Run just this slice while iterating:

```bash
npx playwright test --grep "@queryEditor"      # all Query Editor specs
npx playwright test queryEditor-paging         # one file by name substring
```

Conventions every Query Editor spec follows:

- tag the describe block `{ tag: '@queryEditor' }` and `test.skip` when
  `COSMOSDB_E2E_SKIP_EMULATOR=1`;
- `beforeEach`: `maximizeWindow` → `attachEmulator` → `QueryEditorPage.open` →
  `waitForConnected`;
- `afterEach`: `captureNamedScreenshot(vscodeWindow, 'final')` → `dispose()` →
  `closeAllEditorTabs` (plus `resetNativeDialogStubs` / close any Document tab a
  test opened);
- the **page-size confirmation** is a _native_ Electron dialog, so drive it with
  `stubMessageBoxButton(vscodeApp, 'Continue' | 'Close')` and restore with
  `resetNativeDialogStubs` — never expect a `.monaco-dialog-box`;
- **`queryEditor-tree-open.spec.ts`** is the only tree-driven spec: it expands the
  attached emulator in the Cosmos DB Workspaces tree and invokes the production
  "Open Query Editor" container action. Keep tree navigation out of the other
  specs (it is slower and more brittle than the command shortcut).
- **`queryEditor-crud.spec.ts`** is **self-contained**: it creates its OWN
  document with a unique id, queries for exactly that document, then deletes it —
  so it never mutates the shared seed data. Document content is set via the OS
  clipboard (`DocumentPanel.setContent` → Electron `clipboard.writeText` + paste)
  because Monaco's auto-closing brackets/indent corrupt typed JSON. The delete
  confirmation is a native modal — stub it with `stubMessageBoxButton(app, 'Yes')`.
- **keyboard hotkeys** are verified alongside the button actions they mirror, in
  the same spec/case: editor-scoped shortcuts (Ctrl+O / Ctrl+S) via
  `pressEditorHotkey`, result-panel-scoped ones (paging, Refresh, Copy/Export,
  item View/Edit/New/Delete) via `pressResultHotkey` / `focusResultPanel` + key.
  A hotkey only fires when focus is inside its bound scope, so always focus the
  editor or result panel first; item shortcuts (Alt+V/E/D) additionally need a
  selected row, and focusing the result panel before Alt+V/E avoids the host
  menu-bar mnemonics swallowing them. Global shortcuts (Alt+1/2, Alt+Shift+D)
  live in `queryEditor-hotkeys.spec.ts`.

## Cosmos DB emulator

The suite runs against a **dedicated** emulator instance brought up by
`setup/globalSetup.ts` from `docker-compose.e2e.yml`. The compose project is
named `cosmosdb-e2e` and binds to ports **8082 / 1235** instead of the
default 8081 / 1234. This means:

- A developer can keep `npm run docker-up` running on 8081 while iterating;
  the e2e suite won't fight it.
- `docker compose -p cosmosdb-e2e ...` only ever touches our container —
  teardown can't accidentally remove the developer's local data.
- The compose file declares **no volumes** — every test run starts from a
  pristine emulator, and the seed script (`scripts/import-seed.mjs`)
  recreates database + containers + documents on each `up`.

### Coordinates injected into VS Code

`globalSetup` writes the emulator config into `.vscode-test/e2e-config.json`,
which the fixture reads and re-exports as env vars to the launched VS Code:

| Env var                          | Default                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `COSMOSDB_E2E_EMULATOR_ENDPOINT` | `https://localhost:8082` |
| `COSMOSDB_E2E_EMULATOR_KEY`      | well-known emulator key  |
| `COSMOSDB_E2E_DATABASE_ID`       | `nosql-test-db`          |
| `COSMOSDB_E2E_CONTAINER_ID`      | `products`               |

The extension trusts the emulator's self-signed certificate via a **scoped**
`https.Agent` (see `src/cosmosdb/getCosmosClient.ts`, gated on
`isEmulator: true`). No process-wide `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` is
needed for the test runner or the seed script (both pass a scoped agent
directly to their `CosmosClient`).

The test-only commands registered in `src/commands/e2eTestCommands/` read
these env vars and build a real `NoSqlQueryConnection`:

- **`cosmosDB.e2e.openQueryEditor`** — opens QueryEditor against the seeded
  container.
- **`cosmosDB.e2e.openDocument`** — opens Document tab in `add` mode.
- **`cosmosDB.e2e.attachEmulator`** — pushes an attached-account entry into
  workspace storage so the Cosmos DB Workspaces tree shows the emulator
  without going through the "Attach Database Account" wizard.

Each command also accepts an optional `args: { endpoint, key, databaseId,
containerId }` override so a spec can target other databases without
re-launching VS Code.

### Manual / debug commands

```bash
npm run e2e:emulator:up      # bring the e2e emulator up (no Playwright)
npm run e2e:emulator:seed    # re-seed the test database
npm run e2e:emulator:down    # tear it down
```

### Skip the emulator entirely

Pure-webview smoke specs don't need a live backend. Set
`COSMOSDB_E2E_SKIP_EMULATOR=1` before `npm run e2e` and `globalSetup` will
skip both the docker spawn and the seed import. The fixture also omits the
emulator env vars, so the test-only commands fall back to disconnected
mode (panel mounts, tRPC calls fail through the existing error-toast
pipeline).

## Patterns adopted from `vs-code-postgresql`

1. Import the fixture: `import { expect, test } from '../fixtures/vscode';`
2. Add `test.afterEach(async ({ vscodeWindow }) => closeAllEditorTabs(vscodeWindow))`
   so your test doesn't leak panels into the next.
3. Pick a command from `package.json#contributes.commands` whose label you
   know (look up the `%key%` in `package.nls.json`).
4. `await runCommand(vscodeWindow, 'Cosmos DB: Your Command');`
5. `await getWebviewByPredicate(vscodeWindow, async (frame) => …)` — the
   predicate should assert that something specific to your webview has
   rendered (a button label, a heading). That doubles as a "wait until the
   React app mounted" check.
6. Drive the webview with standard Playwright APIs on the returned `Frame`.

## Controlling window chrome (side bars / panel)

VS Code is reused per worker and the activation handshake opens the Azure side
bar; on a fresh profile the GitHub Copilot Chat secondary side bar can also
auto-pop. Both steal horizontal space and clutter the window screenshots we
attach for webview tests.

Every test gets a **`layout`** option (see `helpers/windowLayout.ts`) that the
auto `windowLayout` fixture enforces before the test body runs. The default
hides the Copilot Chat secondary side bar and the bottom panel; the primary
side bar is left untouched.

```ts
// Default per test (no opt-in needed):
//   { secondarySideBar: false, panel: false }

// Override per file / describe / test. Your object is merged over the
// defaults, so you only restate the parts you want to change — a key you
// pass wins, a key you omit keeps its default (and parts absent from both
// are left untouched):
test.use({ layout: { primarySideBar: false } });           // also hide the tree
test.use({ layout: { secondarySideBar: true } });          // show Copilot Chat
test.use({ layout: { primarySideBar: false, panel: false } });
```

You can also apply a layout inline from within a test (e.g. mid-test):

```ts
import { applyWindowLayout } from '../helpers/windowLayout';

await applyWindowLayout(vscodeWindow, { panel: true });
```

The helper diffs against the live workbench DOM and issues a visibility-toggle
command only when a part isn't already in the desired state, so re-applying the
same layout is a no-op.

### Patterns deliberately **not** adopted (yet)

- **Multi-editor adapter** (`editors/vsCodeAdapter.ts` + `cursorAdapter.ts`) —
  we only target VS Code.
- **Reusable user-data-dir** for persisted auth — no Entra-style tests yet.
- **`@smoke` / `@requires-*` tag grep filters** — only one test today.
- **JUnit / GitHub reporters** — wire up when CI exists.

## CI notes

- `forbidOnly: true` is enabled on CI (no `.only` slipping into main).
- `retries: 2` on CI to absorb the occasional VS Code window-creation flake.
- `workers: 1` always — multiple VS Code instances can't share
  `--user-data-dir`. CI can override after the suite grows; every worker
  already gets its own temp subtree via the isolation context.

### Workflow

`.github/workflows/e2e.yml` runs the suite on every PR / push that touches
code that could affect webview behaviour (`src/**`, `test/e2e/**`,
`scripts/import-seed.mjs`, `docker-compose.e2e.yml`, `package.json`,
`playwright.config.ts`). Path-filtered to keep CI cost low on unrelated
commits. Manual `workflow_dispatch` is also available.

On Linux runners the steps are:

1. `npm ci`
2. `npx playwright install-deps chromium` — provides the GTK/NSS shared
   libs the downloaded VS Code Electron build needs.
3. `npm run vite-prod` — explicit build so failures surface separately
   from test failures. `COSMOSDB_E2E_SKIP_BUILD=1` is then set so
   `globalSetup` doesn't re-walk `src/` for the freshness check.
4. `xvfb-run -a npm run e2e` — mandatory wrapper, Electron has no real
   headless mode.

On failure, three artifacts are uploaded for post-mortem:

- `e2e-html-report-<attempt>` — Playwright HTML report (test list, traces,
  screenshots, video links).
- `e2e-results-<attempt>` — raw traces / videos / `error-context.md` files.
- `e2e-emulator-logs-<attempt>` — `docker logs` of the e2e emulator
  container (helps when readiness or seed timed out).
