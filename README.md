## Attach to the Cosmos DB Emulator

Attach the Cosmos DB Emulator to work with a local instance of Cosmos DB for development and testing purposes.

- **Emulator Installation**: Install and run the [Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) on your local machine.
- **Attach Emulator**: Right-click 'Attached Database Accounts' and select 'Attach Emulator' to link the emulator to your workspace.

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues and limitations to be aware of when using the Azure Databases extension:

- **Gremlin Endpoint Limitation**: Azure no longer supports Gremlin queries on pre-GA graph accounts. If you encounter an error like "Could not find a valid gremlin endpoint for _graph_", open the graph node in the portal and verify the "Gremlin Endpoint" format. If it does not match the expected form '...[graph-name].**_gremlin_**.cosmosdb.azure.com...', you may need to create a new graph account.
- **Graphs Not Supported with Emulator**: Graphs are not currently supported with the Cosmos DB Emulator.
- **Table Viewing/Editing**: Viewing and editing tables is not currently supported by the extension.
- **Escaped Characters in Scrapbooks**: Scrapbook support for escaped characters is preliminary. Use double escaping for newlines (`\\n` instead of `\n`). If you find issues, report them to [#937](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb/issues/937).
