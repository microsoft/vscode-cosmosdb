# Features

- **Edit Documents and Queries**: Open documents, stored procedures, and queries in the editor.

- **Save Changes**: Make updates and persist them to the cloud.

- **Workspace Support**: Attach database servers to your workspace using connection strings. This is especially useful for teams working with shared resources from various subscriptions.

## Query Editor

The Query Editor allows you to write and execute queries across your databases.

- **Rich Syntax Highlighting**: Highlights query syntax to make it more readable and help prevent errors.

- **Query History**: Automatically saves previously executed queries, allowing you to open and reuse them later.

- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and view results in Table, JSON, or Tree view.

- **Export Results**: Provides options to copy query results as JSON or CSV or to save them to a file for later use.

- **Emulator Installation**: Install and run the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) on your local machine.

- **New Emulator Connection**: Expand 'CosmosDB Accounts', next expand 'Local Emulators', and select 'New Emulator Connection' to link the emulator to your workspace.

> [!WARNING]

> Support for previously included features such as Universal MongoDB and PostgreSQL has been moved to separate extensions. You can find the [DocumentDB Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-documentdb) and the [PostgreSQL Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-ossdata.vscode-pgsql).

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues and limitations to be aware of when using the Azure Cosmos DB extension:

- **Table Viewing/Editing**: Viewing and editing tables is not currently supported by the extension.

- **Escaped Characters in Scrapbooks**: Scrapbook support for escaped characters is preliminary. Use double escaping for newlines (`\\n` instead of `\n`). If you find issues, report them to [#937](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb/issues/937).
