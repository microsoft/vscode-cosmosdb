## Scrapbooks

### Run Mongo Commands with Rich Intellisense

- View your MongoDB database account by clicking "Sign in to Azure..." in the Azure Resources explorer or using "Attach Database Account" to connect via a connection string
- Optionally configure the settings `mongo.shell.path` and `mongo.shell.args` if your mongo executable is not already on your system's PATH (many of the common commands have built-in support and do not require the Mongo shell to be installed - see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites))
- Click on "New Mongo Scrapbook" in the tree title bar
- Click on "Connect to a database" to indicate which database to run the commands against
- Enter your commands and/or comments, eg: `db.<collectionName>.find()`
- IntelliSense (auto-completions) will be provided
- Click on "Execute" above a command to execute it, or press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>"</kbd> (Mac) or <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>"</kbd> (Windows and Linux) to execute the line with the cursor
- To run all commands, click on "Execute All", or press <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>:</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>:</kbd>
- Save and re-use later

## Import into Cosmos DB

- You can now import documents from your workspace into CosmosDB. Use the context menu of a collection or a document file (json) to get started!

## Create an Azure Databases Server

1. Sign in to your Azure Account by clicking "Sign in to Azure..." in the Azure Resources explorer
   > If you don't already have an Azure Account, select "Create a Free Azure Account"
2. Select the `+` button to open the "Create Resource" menu
   ![Create resource](resources/readme/createResource.png)
3. Choose "Create Database Server..."

## Attach to the Cosmos DB Emulator

- Install and run the [Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) on your local machine
- Right click 'Attached Database Accounts' and select 'Attach Emulator'

![Attach Emulator](resources/readme/attachEmulator.png)

## Known Issues

- Azure no longer supports gremlin queries on pre-GA graph accounts. If you see the error "Could not find a valid gremlin endpoint for _graph_", then choose "Open Portal" on the graph node and check the "Gremlin Endpoint" in the Overview tab. If it does not take the form of '...[graph-name].**_gremlin_**.cosmosdb.azure.com...', then you will need to create a new graph account using the Azure portal or the current version of the extension.
- Graphs are not currently supported with the emulator
- Viewing/editing tables is not currently supported
- Support for escapes in the scrapbooks is preliminary. We currently do not support escaped characters as is inside a string - the characters need to be double escaped. For example, newlines in the string should be '\\\\n' instead of '\\n' to be recognized correctly. If you find any issues with how the scrapbook handles escapes, please add to issue [#937](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb/issues/937).
