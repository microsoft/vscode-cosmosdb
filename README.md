## Azure Cosmos DB Explorer

The Azure Cosmos DB Explorer helps you find, view, and manage your Azure CosmosDB databases.

- **Discover Database Accounts**: scan your Azure subscription for available database accounts and get a structured list of your resources.

- **Open in Azure Portal**: Access database servers directly in the Azure portal.

- **Manage Databases**: View, create, and delete databases, collections, stored procedures, and documents.

- **Edit Documents and Queries**: Open documents, stored procedures, and queries in the editor.

- **Save Changes**: Make updates and persist them to the cloud.

- **Workspace Support**: Attach database accounts to your workspace using connection strings. This is especially useful for teams working with shared resources from various subscriptions.

## Query Editor

The Query Editor allows you to write and execute queries across your databases.

- **Rich Syntax Highlighting**: Highlights query syntax to make it more readable and help prevent errors.

- **Query History**: Automatically saves previously executed queries, allowing you to open and reuse them later.

- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and view results in Table, JSON, or Tree view.

- **Export Results**: Provides options to copy query results as JSON or CSV or to save them to a file for later use.

- **Pagination**: Adjust how many results are displayed at a time when working with large datasets.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The Azure Cosmos DB extension supports various keyboard shortcuts to improve your productivity when working with queries and documents.

For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts, see [Keyboard Shortcuts](docs/hotkeys/01_keyboard_shortcuts.md).

## AI-Powered Query Assistance (GitHub Copilot)

The extension integrates with GitHub Copilot to help you write, edit, and understand Cosmos DB NoSQL queries using natural language.

- **Generate Query**: Click the **AI** button in the Query Editor toolbar and select **Generate query** to describe your query in plain English. Copilot will generate a Cosmos DB NoSQL query for you.

- **Explain Query**: Click the **AI** button and select **Explain query** to get a plain-English explanation of the current query in the editor.

- **`@cosmosdb` Chat Participant**: Use `@cosmosdb` in VS Code Chat (Copilot) with dedicated commands:
  - `/generateQuery` – Generate a new query from a description.
  - `/explainQuery` – Explain an existing query.
  - `/editQuery` – Edit or optimize a query based on instructions.

> **Requires** the [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension and an active Copilot subscription.

For more details, see the [AI Chat documentation](src/chat/README.md).

## Import into Azure Cosmos DB

The extension allows you to import documents into CosmosDB.

- **Workspace Integration**: Use the context menu of a collection or document file (JSON) to initiate import.

- **Emulator Installation**: Install and run the [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) on your local machine.

- **New Emulator Connection**: Expand 'CosmosDB Accounts', next expand 'Local Emulators', and select 'New Emulator Connection' to link the emulator to your workspace.
