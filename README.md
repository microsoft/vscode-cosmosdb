# Features

## Azure Databases Explorer

The Azure Databases Explorer helps you find, view, and manage your Azure databases.

- **Discover Database Servers**: scan your Azure subscription for available database servers and get a structured list of your resources.


- **Open in Azure Portal**: Access database servers directly in the Azure portal.

- **Manage Databases**: View, create, and delete databases, collections, stored procedures, and documents.

- **Edit Documents and Queries**: Open documents, stored procedures, and queries in the editor.

- **Save Changes**:  Make updates and persist them to the cloud.

- **Workspace Support**: Attach database servers to your workspace using connection strings. This is especially useful for teams working with shared resources from various subscriptions.

- **MongoDB Connectivity**: Connect to MongoDB databases on Azure and beyond using connection strings.

## Query Editor

The Query Editor allows you to write and execute queries across your databases.

- **Rich Syntax Highlighting**: Highlights query syntax to make it more readable and help prevent errors.

- **Query History**: Automatically saves previously executed queries, allowing you to open and reuse them later.

- **Run Queries**: Execute queries and view results in Table, JSON, or Tree view.

- **Export Results**: Provides options to copy query results as JSON or CSV or to save them to a file for later use.

- **Pagination**: Adjust how many results are displayed at a time when working with large datasets.

- **Query Insights and Index Advisor**: Displays key details such as execution time, resource consumption, and indexing recommendations.

## Universal MongoDB Support

The Azure Databases VS Code Extension supports MongoDB, making it easier to connect to and manage different types of MongoDB databases:

- **Works with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB**: Connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB, including both Request Units (RU) and vCore-based models. Browse, query, and modify data without leaving VS Code.

- **Supports Any MongoDB Database**: Connect to any MongoDB instance, whether itâ€™s hosted on Azure, another cloud provider, or a local server.

- **Different Ways to View Data**: Explore collections using Table, Tree, or JSON views. Paging controls help manage large datasets.

- **Enhanced Query Experience**: Execute find queries with syntax highlighting and intelligent auto-completion, including field name suggestions, to reduce errors.

- **Edit and Manage Documents**: Open, edit, and delete individual documents directly in the extension.

- **JSON Import and Export**: Import data from JSON files or export documents as needed. You can even export entire collections or the result of a query, making data sharing simpler and more efficient.

## Import into Cosmos DB

The extension allows you to import documents into CosmosDB.

- **Workspace Integration**: Use the context menu of a collection or document file (JSON) to initiate import.

## Attach to the Cosmos DB Emulator

Attach the Cosmos DB Emulator to work with a local instance of Cosmos DB for development and testing purposes.

- **Emulator Installation**: Install and run the [Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) on your local machine.

- **New Emulator Connection**: Expand 'Attached Database Accounts', next expand 'Local Emulators', and select 'New Emulator Connection' to link the emulator to your workspace.

# Prerequisites

- **Mongo Shell Requirement (Optional)**: Some advanced commands in the Mongo [scrapbook](#mongo-scrapbooks) and use of the Mongo shell require installing [Mongo DB and Mongo shell](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

## Known Issues

Here are some known issues and limitations to be aware of when using the Azure Databases extension:

- **Gremlin Endpoint Limitation**: Azure no longer supports Gremlin queries on pre-GA graph accounts. If you encounter an error like "Could not find a valid gremlin endpoint for _graph_", open the graph node in the portal and verify the "Gremlin Endpoint" format. If it does not match the expected form '...[graph-name].**_gremlin_**.cosmosdb.azure.com...', you may need to create a new graph account.

- **Graphs Not Supported with Emulator**: Graphs are not currently supported with the Cosmos DB Emulator.

- **Table Viewing/Editing**: Viewing and editing tables is not currently supported by the extension.

- **Escaped Characters in Scrapbooks**: Scrapbook support for escaped characters is preliminary. Use double escaping for newlines (`\\n` instead of `\n`). If you find issues, report them to [#937](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cosmosdb/issues/937).
